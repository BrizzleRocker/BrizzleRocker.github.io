# MAG unite with industry on a motorcycling ‘Journey to a Brighter Destination’.

Date: 23 February 2022

News from the Motorcycle Action Group (MAG)

The Motorcycle Action Group (MAG) is uniting with the Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA) to make the case for motorcycling.  MAG has collaborated with the MCIA and endorses the long awaited ‘Journey to a Brighter Destination’ document in support of leisure motorcycling.

Motorcycles offer significant environmental, economic, and societal benefits to the UK’s transport population. ‘The Journey’ puts forward a compelling case for why motorcycling as a leisure activity, primarily using higher-powered motorcycles, must be protected as the Government heads towards a net zero future.  This future can, and will, be bright for motorcycling but only if the Government ensures that the right level of support is in place, starting from now, both in terms of financial consumer incentives and also the time and investment needed for us to adapt to new powertrains, electrical or otherwise.

MAG Chair, Neil Liversidge, said:

“MAG welcomes the highly significant statement of intent which the Motorcycle Industry Association’s (MCIA) ‘Journey’ report represents. The document lays out a clear position on the importance of motorcycling as it stands today in the context of leisure, pastimes, and sports. It also confirms the industry’s commitment to develop a strategy to create a foundation for the continuation of motorcycling as we know it. Further, it considers all the things that are important to today’s riders. The objective is to ensure not only that motorcycling continues, but that it also attracts a new, younger, and growing audience in the years to come.

“MAG and MCIA are closely aligned in many key areas. MAG recognises that the industry must naturally operate within and introduce products to market that cannot just be eligible to be offered for sale, but also be demanded by the changing marketplace. It is appreciated; however, this must not just be shaped by government policy alone but also what inspires the customer. As Government moves ahead with its agenda and objectives for net zero by 2050, MAG will work closely with MCIA to ensure the riders voices are heard with an objective of ensuring these opinions sufficiently influence policy proposals and the final outcomes.

“We are looking forward to working with MCIA and, together, feel much can be gained by working collaboratively, but with a mutual appreciation of each organisation’s beliefs and objectives.”

Tony Campbell, CEO of MCIA, said:

“Today’s publication is all about celebrating what we all know and love. Underlying this is the need to showcase the significant benefits our industry brings to the UK economy and our society more generally.

“Though we are making significant progress in the lower powered end of the L-Category classification and the role these vehicles can, are and will play in the Government’s zero emission and future of transport agendas, higher powered motorcycles will need to be treated differently, as they face far greater challenges when it comes to electrification using technologies that are available today.

“With the consultation on the phase out of new non-zero emission L-Category vehicles expected this year, The Journey puts forward a powerful case for why certain parts of our sector must be given more time to adapt before working towards any arbitrary phase out date.

“The Government must, at the very least, have an open mind to alternative fuels/powertrains, move away from focusing exclusively on zero emissions at the tailpipe and, ultimately, be proportionate in its prescribing the sector a phase out date based on both our current UK emissions contribution and the whole life cycle environmental impact of these vehicle types.

“We are looking forward to continuing our work with Government, helping to shape the phase out consultation, and remain steadfast in ensuring progress towards net zero in a way that is both commercially viable for manufacturers and appealing to our riding community.”
