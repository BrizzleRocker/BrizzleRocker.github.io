# Electric vehicle infrastructure strategy inadequate for motorcyclists.

News from the Motorcycle Action Group (MAG)

The Motorcycle Action Group (MAG) has said that the newly published ‘Electric vehicle infrastructure strategy’ is inadequate for meeting the needs of motorcyclists wanting to go electric.

On Friday 25th March Grant Shapps announced the UK’s £1.6 billion Electric vehicle infrastructure strategy.  MAG responded to consultations prior to the policy development calling for the specific needs of motorcyclists to be fully considered.

MAG welcomes the comments that all Local Transport Plan EV charging strategy must consider charging opportunities for electric motorbikes, as well as cars and vans.  The strategy gives little, however, to reassure that the promised guidance for local authorities will be adequate.

MAG Director of Campaigns & Political Engagement, Colin Brown, said:

“For those riders wanting to make the switch to electric, there is insufficient detail in this strategy to reassure.  Motorcycles will need dedicated facilities with different ergonomic design and a strong focus on security against theft.  There is also nothing to indicate that potential for interchangeable batteries and associated charging hubs has been recognised.”

MAG continues to oppose the proposed phase-out of internal combustion engine motorcycles, but still wishes to ensure that, for those who do choose electric, motorcycle charging infrastructure will not be ignored.

Colin went on to say:

“We are pro choice when it comes to the future of motorcycling.  It is imperative that the broadest range of choices are catered for. Certainly, if the Government wants to achieve decarbonisation of all transport modes, they need to fully consider all the details - even for motorcycles. We will be seeking to influence the drafting of detailed guidance for local authorities.”
