# MAG to collaborate with MCIA on decarbonisation plan.

Date: 07 February 2022

News from the Motorcycle Action Group (MAG)

The Motorcycle Action Group (MAG) has announced that it will be collaborating with the Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA) to develop the Action Plan for decarbonisation of powered light vehicles (PLVs). The Action Plan was launched last Wednesday.  MAG will be holding an initial meeting with the MCIA on 9th February.

MAG pointed out to both MCIA and the Department for Transport (DfT) that the opinions and interests of riders must be a key component when designing the future of motorcycling.  MAG is keen to work with both industry and policy makers to ensure the best possible outcome for riders in the UK.

MCIA Chief Executive, Tony Campbell, said:

“Following the Motorcycle Actions Group’s Press Release in reaction to the launch of the joint Government / Motorcycle Industry action plan, MCIA acknowledges MAG members’ passion and enthusiasm for motorcycling, and MAG’s commitment to protecting their freedom of choice. It must not be forgotten that MAG members are also our customers - and therefore we fully intend to work closely with MAG ensuring that, as the action plan evolves into actual outputs, where relevant these outputs will be developed with the riders’ views in mind. It is good to read that MAG are supportive. MCIA agrees that pure electric will not be the only solution and therefore we will be working closely with MCIA Manufacturer members and Government ensuring that as new technologies evolve (including synthetic combustible fuels) all options remain open”.

MAG Chair, Neil Liversidge, commented:

“I’m very pleased that this mutual approach has been established.  We at MAG understand the MCIA’s recommended actions and look forward to discussing the policy positions of the various groups involved in this important strategic agenda.  I am also very encouraged that the MCIA and MAG are now converging towards a more aligned way of working. This is bound to create the strongest possible voice in the interests of motorcyclists and manufacturers, in terms of UK policy development and the wider debate on environmental policies.”
