# MAG welcomes NABD to UK Motorcycling

Date: 3 March 2022

News from the Motorcycle Action Group (MAG)

The Motorcycle Action Group (MAG), the UK’s leading voice for riders, has welcomed the National Association of Bikers with a Disability (NABD) to UK Motorcycling (UKM).

NABD, the world’s leading support group for motorcyclists with disabilities, is to join UKM, which was recently formed by The Motorcycle Action Group.  The Motor Cycle Industry Association (MCIA) is also part of this new organisation.

Welcoming NABD to UKM, MAG’s Chairman, Neil F Liversidge, said:

“It’s great to have NABD joining us.  UKM will give a voice to all motorcyclists, working for their benefit and for the benefit of motorcycling in all its forms.  It is especially important for us to have NABD on board because no organisation in the entire world has more experience in its specialism.”

NABD National Chairman, Rick Hulse, commented:

“The NABD welcomes this opportunity to take part in this collaborative forum, an opportunity never afforded to us by the National Motorcycle Council (NMC).

We have been successful in influencing legislation, both domestic and European, on numerous occasions over the past 30+ years.  Now, with this opportunity to act in unity with other motorcycling organisations via the new UKM group, we look forward to being even more effective in protecting the rights and freedoms enjoyed by both motorcyclists with disabilities and the wider motorcycling community.”
