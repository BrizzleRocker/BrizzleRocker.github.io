# Press Release: MAG withdraws from the National Motorcycle Council (NMC)

Date: 22 February 2022

MAG have today announced they are leaving the National Motorcyclists Council in favour of setting up a new forum which will be known as UK Motorcycling (UKM). The objective for this new discussion forum is to create a collaborative meeting environment where all stakeholders can share views and opinions on what will be a challenging few years ahead for Motorcycling in the UK.

Explaining the move, MAG National Chairman, Neil Liversidge, said:

“We are more than capable of communicating with Government without a third-party interlocutor, and we need to spend our resources efficiently.  MAG has good working relationships with all current NMC partners and the industry representative body, The Motorcycle Industry Association. Our aim is to direct all efforts and resources towards lobbying the Government, and any lobbying effort, to be realistic, must include the industry.”

“We are therefore looking to build on our existing relationship with the current NMC partners and the industry. MAG over recent times have been developing an excellent working relationship with MCIA and are keen to grow this further still. It is by working more collaboratively and with all major stakeholders we will ensure all are heard by Government, sensibly co-ordinating our lobbying efforts with each other for the benefit of UK motorcyclists, and for motorcycling in all its forms.”
